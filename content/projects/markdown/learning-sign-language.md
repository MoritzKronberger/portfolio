'Learning Sign Language' is currently my main active project and part of my [European Project Semester](http://www.europeanprojectsemester.eu/).
<br></br>
The main goal is to build the technical framework for a web application, that allows its users to learn the basics of German Sign Language (primarily the signed alphabet),
by providing live feedback on signs shown to a webcam using a custom neural network and tailoring a learning program to the individual user's progress.

We also hope to be able to release a high quality, diverse and open source dataset of the German Sign Language alphabet.
