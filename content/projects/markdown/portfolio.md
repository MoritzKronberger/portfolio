This portfolio website is a fast, accessible, and search engine optimized, server side rendered webpage, built with Nuxt.js.
The use of the Nuxt.js module [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) combined with automated building on Netlify makes for a simple, easy to use, git-based headless CMS.

The responsive website layout was created using SCSS and utilizes dedicated breakpoints for mobile and tablet devices.

Additionally the Nuxt transition functionality was combined with [animate.css](https://animate.style/) to create most of this site's animations.
