'ReadMe' is an application that encourages mindful interaction with text.

As a museum installation it is meant to inform its users about the 2013 NSA spying scandal in just 1000 characters.

## Concept

Everybody who has caught themselves mindlessly scrolling through social media has experienced how un-mindful our daily interactions with written text can be.
But also in our "analog life" places like museums regularly inform us into information overload. While the resulting surface-level skimming of texts is often accounted for by museum-designers certain topics can be incompatible with this type of interaction.

'ReadMe' ties reading together with the elements of damage and regeneration. If a word is underlined by the user's finger it will be encrypted and is no longer readable. Once all text of one chapter is encrypted the next chapter is revealed. The application increases the complexity and friction of the reading task in exchange for a more focused and mindful interaction.

The context of spying serves as an anchor for the entire application's design: from the printed-file-interface to the encryption of "confidential" content.

## Design

The application, including the space it is displayed in, is kept reduced and sterile, to provide no distractions from the interaction and content themselves.
Aesthetically a mix between the old school printed file and a futuristic interface was desired, mixing analog and digital elements.
This contrast is carried through the whole design, including the font and sound design.

## Implementation

The interface is a browser-based application, created using p5.js. To create the projected look for the digital elements, a tablet was covered with tightly stretched 80 g/mÂ² paper, which only allows the white display
light to shine through. As opposed to using a real projector, this approach has the advantage of making direct touch inputs possible and therefore not requiring any external hand tracking, while still providing a surreal feeling interaction.
