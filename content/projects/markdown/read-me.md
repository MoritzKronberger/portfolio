##

ReadMe is an application that encourages midful interaction with text.

As a museum installation it is meant to inform its users about the 2013 NSA spying scandal in ca. 1000 characters.

## Background

Everybody who has caught themselves midlessly scrolling through social media has experienced how un-mindful our daily interactions with written text can be.
But also in our "analog life" places like museums regularly inform us into information overload. While the resulting surface-level skimming of texts is often accounted for by museum-designers certain topics can be incompatible with this type of interaction.

## Concept

ReadMe ties reading together with the elements of damage and regeneration. If a word is underlined by the users finger it will be encrypted and is no longer readable. Once all text of one chapter is encrypted the next chapter is revealed. The application increases the complexity and friction of the redaing task in exchange for a more focused and mindful interaction.

The context of spying serves as an anchor for the entire applications design: from the printed-file-interface to the encryption of "confidential" content.

Both a [live demo of the interface](https://youtu.be/DLCqOZdjk9o) and more in-depth [documentation](https://hsa.incom.org/project/3175) of the project are available.
