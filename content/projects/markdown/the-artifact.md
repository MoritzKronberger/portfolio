The short film "The Artifact" is my interpretation of the following storyline:
<br></br>
'Kevin had lost everything. But someone had forgotten to lock the hangar. The transport ship was under repair, but he could try to pick up one of the artifacts and pay back all his debts.'
<br></br>
The main goal of this short film was to explore different techniques in the SideFX Houdini software.
From particle advection for the tractor-beam over terrain simulation of the alien planet's cratery surface to a rigidbody and smoke simulation of the ufo's crash the project offered vast learning opportunities.

A filpbook render of the animation can be found [here](https://youtu.be/RqPJx0X0gzA).
